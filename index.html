    <p> 
      my name is Stella Cai and I work with digital art programs like Clip Studio Art and Procreate. I find that folklores, fairy tales, myths and religion to be a key part in my art inspiration. I love fantasy creatures like unicorns, vampires, mermaids and fairies! I also draw inspiration from historical fashion such as the Rococo era in France and the hanfu of ancient China.
   
      Many pieces of my work contain themes of whimsy and fantasy. There are also a bunch of small details that go into my subjectâ€™s clothing since clothing is a big part of my art. It brings me joy whenever I get to draw drapery.
      For inspiration, I frequent Pinterest and Instagram for references. By compiling albums of reference photos, it helps me better map out the overall feel I want for the piece of artwork. I also take inspiration from digital games and 3D models. I grew up with a lot of exposure to games and that has shaped me to take on a digital painting style.
